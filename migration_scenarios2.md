In the scenario core banking migration was perfromed and went smoothly, however, an issue revolved around the integration of third-party applications with the newly migrated or upgraded core banking system. This is a common challenge during system upgrades or migrations, especially when different applications need to communicate and exchange data seamlessly.

Here are some potential technical issues that could arise, and examples of errors that might prompt developers to rewrite code for re-integration of third-party apps:

### 1. **API Compatibility Issues**
   When a core banking system is upgraded, the APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) used by third-party applications to interact with the system may change (e.g., new endpoints, different parameter structures, or authentication methods). If the third-party applications rely on outdated APIs, they could fail to communicate properly.

   **Sample Error:**
   - **HTTP 404 (Not Found)** or **HTTP 410 (Gone)**: The third-party app is trying to access an API endpoint that no longer exists or has been deprecated.
   - **Invalid request body format**: If the request payload structure expected by the new API has changed, third-party applications may fail to send or receive data in the correct format.

   **Example Log Message:**
   - `Error: Invalid API Endpoint. Path /v1/getAccountDetails not found.`
   - `400 Bad Request: Missing required field 'accountStatus' in request body.`

### 2. **Database Schema Changes**
   The core banking system’s database schema (structure of tables, columns, relationships) may have been altered during the upgrade. If the third-party apps interact with the core banking database directly (which they often do for data queries or updates), they may fail due to mismatched data structures.

   **Sample Error:**
   - **SQL Error (Invalid Column)**: A column that a third-party app relies on could be removed, renamed, or modified (e.g., data type changed from `varchar` to `int`), causing queries to fail.
   - **Integrity constraint violation**: When new foreign key constraints or unique index rules are introduced in the core database, third-party apps may unknowingly trigger these constraints.

   **Example Log Message:**
   - `SQL Error: Column 'old_customer_id' does not exist in the table 'customer_details'.`
   - `Integrity constraint violation: Cannot insert NULL into column 'transaction_id'.`

### 3. **Authentication and Authorization Issues**
   The security models (e.g., OAuth tokens, JWT, or API keys) used by the third-party apps to authenticate and authorize with the core banking system may have changed. Upgrades often involve enhanced security protocols or changes in authentication mechanisms.

   **Sample Error:**
   - **401 Unauthorized**: The third-party app is unable to authenticate due to outdated API keys or credentials.
   - **403 Forbidden**: Even with valid credentials, the third-party app might be restricted from accessing certain resources due to updated permission models.

   **Example Log Message:**
   - `Error: Authorization failed for user 'third_party_app' on resource '/accounts/12345'.`
   - `Token expired or invalid: Authentication failed for client 'payment_gateway'.`

### 4. **Message Format and Protocol Mismatch**
   If the core banking system has switched to different message formats (e.g., JSON to XML or vice versa) or uses a different protocol (e.g., SOAP to REST or HTTP to gRPC), third-party apps may not be able to communicate effectively.

   **Sample Error:**
   - **Deserialization Error**: If the format of the response from the core banking system changes, the third-party app might fail to parse the data.
   - **Protocol mismatch**: If a third-party app was designed to communicate via SOAP, and the core banking system has now adopted a REST API, communication will break.

   **Example Log Message:**
   - `Error: Unable to parse response: Expected XML, but received JSON.`
   - `Protocol Error: Expected SOAP, but received HTTP response code 200 OK.`

### 5. **Timeouts and Latency**
   Performance-related issues, such as slower-than-expected responses or timeouts, could occur if the new core banking system takes longer to process requests. This could lead to third-party apps either timing out or retrying requests unnecessarily.

   **Sample Error:**
   - **Request Timeout**: The third-party app times out waiting for a response from the core banking system.
   - **504 Gateway Timeout**: The third-party application’s server may timeout waiting for a response from the core banking API due to network bottlenecks or delays in processing.

   **Example Log Message:**
   - `Error: Request timed out after 30 seconds while waiting for response from '/getBalance'.`
   - `504 Gateway Timeout: Failed to fetch transaction details from core system.`

### 6. **Versioning and Dependency Mismatches**
   If third-party applications depend on libraries or SDKs that are tied to the previous version of the core banking system, they may encounter issues due to incompatibilities with the new system’s version. This could include deprecated functions, new versions of dependencies, or unsupported frameworks.

   **Sample Error:**
   - **Dependency Conflict**: The third-party app uses a library or framework that is no longer supported by the updated core banking system.
   - **Version mismatch**: The core system might be running a newer or incompatible version of a software component that breaks existing third-party app integrations.

   **Example Log Message:**
   - `Error: Unsupported SDK version. Please upgrade to version 3.1.2 or later.`
   - `Error: Class 'OldEncryptionLibrary' not found in the third-party app.`

### 7. **Data Format or Currency Conversion Issues**
   If there were changes in how data is formatted (e.g., changes in currency symbols, date formats, or localization changes), the third-party apps could experience issues in processing or displaying the data.

   **Sample Error:**
   - **Invalid Currency Format**: The third-party app might not recognize new currency codes or symbols if the format was altered during the upgrade.
   - **Date Parsing Errors**: If the core banking system adopts a new date/time format (e.g., from `MM/DD/YYYY` to `ISO 8601`), the third-party app may fail to parse dates properly.

   **Example Log Message:**
   - `Error: Failed to parse date format '2023-11-11T10:00:00Z'. Expected 'MM/DD/YYYY'.`
   - `Invalid currency symbol '$' for account transactions.`

### Why Developers May Choose to Re-Write Code Instead of Tweaking:
- **Drastic API/Protocol Changes**: When the integration protocols (e.g., from SOAP to REST) or data formats change significantly, developers may find it easier to rewrite code than attempt minor tweaks, as the existing logic may no longer be compatible with the new architecture.
- **Code Incompatibility**: If the original code was written in a language or framework that is no longer supported by the new core banking system, developers may be forced to rewrite modules in a newer programming language that aligns with the new system.
- **Future-proofing**: Rewriting code can also provide an opportunity to optimize the integration, enhance security, and ensure long-term maintainability, rather than applying temporary fixes.
  
### Lesson: Importance of Comprehensive End-to-End Testing
This situation underscores the need for thorough end-to-end testing during upgrades or migrations. Testing should include all integrations between the core system and third-party applications to catch these types of issues early.
